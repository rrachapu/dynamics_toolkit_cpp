# dynamics_toolkit_cpp
Developing this as a learning exercise for git, c++, modelling, physics, and data structures

## Setup:

Use the following to set C++ up
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp

With git bash (the program), create a folder and clone this repo with:
'''
git clone https://github.com/rrachapu/dynamics_toolkit_cpp.git
'''

## Initial Classes

### Hello World Class

'''
git checkout -b sandbox/hello_world_INITIALS
'''

1. Make a new hello world class
2. create makefile to compile hello world class

'''
git add -A
git commit "my hello world"
git push
'''
 
Alternatively to 'git add -A', you can individually add all your files with 'git add filename'
'git rm' will remove something from being committed.
